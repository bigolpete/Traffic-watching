# Traffic-Watcher

A solution to get a route's current traffic (using Google maps API) in minutes and send to an Arduino. 

Arduino will execute different instructions based on how many minutes the route takes.

# Configure this solution

Add your google maps API to App.sample.config 
Rename the file to App.config


# TODO

Make route origin and destination easier to configure.
